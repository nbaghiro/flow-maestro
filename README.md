> Build, Deploy, and Scale AI Workflows with Visual Orchestration

![FlowMaestro Workflow Builder](_demos/readme-preview.png)

FlowMaestro is a production-ready platform for orchestrating complex AI agent workflows through a visual canvas interface. Design multi-step AI processes, connect different language models, integrate external services, and monitor execution in real-time—all without writing code.

## What is FlowMaestro?

FlowMaestro enables teams to build sophisticated AI workflows by visually connecting nodes that represent different operations: LLM calls, conditional logic, data transformations, API integrations, and human-in-the-loop interactions.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Design AI workflows with drag-and-drop simplicity
- **Durable Execution**: Workflows survive system failures and can be paused, resumed, and retried
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Cohere in a single workflow
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch your workflows execute with live progress updates
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built for scale with AWS deployment, monitoring, and security

- **Version Control**: Track workflow versions and enable rollback
- **Test Mode**: Test workflows with sample inputs before deployment

### AI & LLM Integration

### Data & Integrations
- **File Operations**: Parse PDFs, CSVs, XML, and JSON files
- **Database Connectors**: Query PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and other databases
- **HTTP/API Calls**: Make REST API calls with automatic retry logic
- **Data Transformation**: JSONata and JMESPath for complex data mapping
- **Pre-built Integrations**: Slack, Notion, Email, and custom webhooks

### Workflow Control
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause workflows for human input, review, or approval
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff and error propagation
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for external API calls
- **Batch Processing**: Execute multiple workflow instances in parallel
- **Code Execution**: Sandboxed JavaScript/Python for custom logic

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live updates for workflow execution
- **Execution Logs**: Comprehensive logs for compliance and debugging
- **Audit Trail**: Full execution history for every workflow run
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor pending, running, completed, and failed executions

## Use Cases

### Multi-Agent AI Systems
Orchestrate multiple AI agents with different specializations working together. For example:
- Research agent → Analysis agent → Writing agent → Review agent
- Different models for different tasks (GPT-4 for reasoning, Claude for writing)

### Document Processing Pipelines
Extract, transform, and analyze documents with AI-powered workflows:
- Upload PDF → Extract text → Summarize with LLM → Store in database
- Process invoices, contracts, or reports automatically

### Customer Support Automation
Build intelligent support bots with escalation paths:
- Receive customer message → Classify intent → Route to appropriate response
- Escalate to human agent when needed with full context

### Content Generation
Create complex content pipelines with review steps:
- Generate blog outline → Write sections → Review quality → Publish
- Multiple revisions with different LLMs for creativity and polish

### Data Enrichment
Combine multiple data sources and AI models:
- Fetch customer data → Enrich with external APIs → Analyze sentiment → Update CRM
- Generate insights and recommendations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20.0.0
- **Docker Desktop** (for PostgreSQL, Redis, Temporal)
- **npm** >= 10.0.0

### Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**1. Clone and Install**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowmaestro.git
cd flowmaestro
npm install
```

**2. Configure Environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (optional for testing)
```

**3. Start Infrastructure**
```bash
npm run docker:up
```

**4. Start Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**5. Access the Application**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Temporal UI**: http://localhost:8088

**Default Login**: `test@flowmaestro.dev` / `testpassword123`

### Build Your First Workflow

1. Click "New Workflow" in the workflow library
2. Drag an **Input** node onto the canvas
3. Add an **LLM** node and connect it to the input
4. Add an **Output** node and connect it to the LLM
5. Configure each node by clicking on it
6. Click "Test" to execute with sample inputs
7. Watch real-time progress in the execution panel

## Core Concepts

### Workflows
A workflow is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of nodes connected by edges. Each node performs a specific operation, and edges define the execution order.

### Nodes
Nodes are the building blocks of workflows. There are 23+ node types organized by category:
- **Input/Output**: Define workflow inputs and outputs
- **AI**: LLM, Vision, Audio, Embeddings
- **Logic**: Conditional, Switch, Loop
- **Data**: Transform, Variable, File Operations
- **Integration**: HTTP, Database, Slack, Email
- **Control**: Wait, User Input, Code Execution

### Executions
An execution is a single run of a workflow with specific input parameters. Executions can be monitored in real-time and have statuses: pending, running, completed, failed, or cancelled.

### Variables
Variables allow nodes to reference outputs from previous nodes. Use `${node_id.output_field}` syntax to dynamically insert values.

### Connections
External service connections (API keys, OAuth tokens) are stored securely and can be reused across workflows. Supported providers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Slack, and more.
