## Latency Comparison

### Simple Workflow (3 outputs)

| Metric | Telnyx Native | LiveKit+Telnyx |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Time to first output | 2900ms | 1000ms |
| Per-output overhead | 650ms | 170ms |
| **Winner** | | **LiveKit (3x faster)** |

### Interactive (Ask → User speaks → Response)

| Metric | Telnyx Native | LiveKit+Telnyx |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Total round-trip | 9750ms | 3220ms |
| Response latency | 2550ms | 670ms |

## Audio Quality & Control

### Telnyx Native
- ❌ No control over audio pipeline
- ❌ Cannot interrupt playback
- ❌ Cannot apply effects/filters
- ❌ Fixed 8kHz sample rate (phone quality)
- ❌ G.711 codec only
- ✅ Telnyx handles codec negotiation

### LiveKit+Telnyx
- ✅ Full control over audio pipeline
- ✅ Can interrupt playback (barge-in)
- ✅ Can apply effects (volume, noise suppression)
- ✅ Flexible sample rate (8-48kHz)
- ✅ Opus codec (adaptive, better quality)
- ✅ Built-in noise cancellation & echo cancellation
- ✅ Can mix multiple audio sources

**Winner: LiveKit** - Superior quality and control

---

## Interactive Features (STT)

### Telnyx Native: Recording-Based
**Process:** Start recording → Wait → Stop recording → Download → Transcribe

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No streaming transcription (wait for complete utterance)
- ❌ No partial results
- ❌ Crude silence detection (fixed timeout)
- ❌ No barge-in support
- ❌ 400-600ms recording overhead
- ❌ File management required
- ❌ Cannot switch STT language mid-call

**Edge cases:**
- User speaks before recording starts → missed
- User pauses mid-sentence → cut off
- Background noise → poor transcription

### LiveKit+Telnyx: Streaming STT
**Process:** Always listening → Transcribe in real-time → Auto-detect end-of-speech

**Features:**
- ✅ Streaming transcription (see text as user speaks)
- ✅ Partial results available
- ✅ Smart VAD (adapts to speaker cadence)
- ✅ Barge-in support
- ✅ No file management
- ✅ Can switch languages dynamically
- ✅ Keyword detection during speech

**Winner: LiveKit** - Vastly superior for interactive

- Adaptive bitrate
- Auto-reconnect with resume capability
- Jitter buffer smooths timing

### User Hangs Up Mid-Workflow

**Telnyx Native:**
- Workflow might complete anyway (wasted compute)
- In-flight API calls fail
- Manual cleanup needed

**LiveKit+Telnyx:**
- Agent detects disconnect immediately
- Clean cancellation
- Room auto-destructs

**Winner: LiveKit** - Better resilience

## Final Recommendation

**Start with Telnyx Native** because:
1. Validate concept faster (1-2 weeks vs 2-3 weeks)
2. Lower cost during testing ($45 vs $78/month)
3. Simpler to debug and iterate
4. Can upgrade later (not locked in)
5. 80% of use cases may not need LiveKit

**Upgrade to LiveKit** selectively for:
- Long-form voice input (>20 seconds)
- Multi-turn conversations (>3 exchanges)
